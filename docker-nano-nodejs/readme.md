# docker-nano-nodejs
This builds a docker image based on Microsoft Windows Nano Server and containing Node.js.  The docker image _only_ intalls Node.js and NPM, and adds the install folder to the system path.  There is no additional Windows coniguration (i.e. IIS, firewalls, dns, etc.). The purpose of this image is to allow developers to deploy Node.js applications in environments where a Windows-based system is required or preferred over a Linux distro.  The resulting image (and containers) requires Docker to be installed in a Windows environment or Windows Container services to be enabled.

## Contents
This repo contains two files:

1. `build.bat` - the executable that downloads everything and builds the docker image
2. `Dockerfile` - the docker build configuration 

## To run
Open a command prompt as an Administrator and within the same directory, run `.\build.bat`

## Process
The batch file automatically performs the following:

1. Downloads the latest version of Node.js LTS (and NPM)
2. Extracts the .msi
3. Downloads the latest version of the `microsoft/nanoserver` docker image
4. Copies the Node.js files to `C:\nodejs` folder within the image
5. Adds `C:\nodejs` to the system path within the image
6. Cleans up artifacts

## Versioning
The `Dockerfile` will contain the current LTS version of Node.js. It will tag the docker image with the version number.  Additionally, all docker images in the public docker hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/a11smiles/nano-nodejs) will be tagged with the appropriate version.

## Public Docker Hub
If your desire is to not build the image yourself and would rather download a pre-built image, you may download it via docker with the command `docker pull a11smiles\nano-nodejs:TAG` where _TAG_ is the version of Node.js LTS you'd like to pull (e.g. 6.9.1).
